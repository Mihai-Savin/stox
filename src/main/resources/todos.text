Add app self-awareness/diagnosis capabilities:
- app components status: polling engine, db connectivity, user identification status
- clear instructions for starting the app: environment setup( intelij, windows shell with maven)

- error occurs when trying to stop the engine via /stop resource
- create multiple threads to poll for data /with some sort of syncing mechanism in place for potential race conditions
- add default builtin user, no need for registering a new user, that is only a showcase feature
